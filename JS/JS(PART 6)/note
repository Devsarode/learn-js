FUNCTIONS IN JS
        - A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
        - Functions are executed when they are called (invoked).
        - Syntax:
                function functionName(parameters) {
                    // code to be executed
                }

                functionName(arguments); // Calling the function

        - Example
                function sayHello() {
                    console.log("Hello, World!");
                }
                sayHello(); // Calling the function

        - Example:
                function greet(name) {
                    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
                }

                console.log(greet("Alice")); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

        - Function Parameters vs Arguments:
                - Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
                - Arguments are the real values passed to the function.
              
                Example:
                function multiply(a, b) { // a and b are parameters
                    return a * b;
                }
                multiply(2, 3); // 2 and 3 are arguments

                when the function is called, the arguments 2 and 3 are passed to the parameters a and b respectively.
                we have to provide the input values (arguments) when calling the function.
                Order of arguments matters; they are assigned to parameters based on their position.

                
        - Return Statement:
                - The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.
                - If no return statement is specified, the function returns undefined by default.       
        - Function Expressions:
                let square = function(number) {
                    return number * number;
                };

                console.log(square(5)); // Outputs: 25


SCOPE 
        -scope determines the accessibility of variables , object and function from different part of the code
                -Function 
                -block
                -Lexical
                -Global
        - tells us which function can be used at a place and which cannot be used 

        -Function Scope:
                - Variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function.
               
                        Example:
                        function myFunction() {
                        let x = 10; // x is function-scoped
                        console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
                        }
                        myFunction();
                        console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined

        -Block Scope:
                - Variables declared with let or const inside a block (e.g., within curly braces {}) are only accessible within that block.
                
                        Example:
                        {
                        let y = 20; // y is block-scoped
                        console.log(y); // Outputs: 20
                        }
                        console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined

        -Lexical Scope:
                - Functions are executed using the scope chain that was in effect when they were defined, not when they are executed.
                - opposite is not true i.e., inner function can access variables of outer function but outer function cannot access variables of inner function.
                - it is like a nested structure where inner functions have access to variables of their outer functions.
                
                NOTE - the inner function has access to the variables even if the variables are declared after the inner function in the outer function.
                        this is because of the way JavaScript handles variable declarations (hoisting). 
                      hoisting allows variable declarations (but not initializations) to be moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
                
                - Inner function cannot be directly accessed from outside its outer function. As it is encapsulated within the outer function [function scope].
                     
                        Example:
                        function outer() {
                        let z = 30;
                        function inner() {
                            console.log(z); // inner function can access z
                        }
                        inner();
                        }
                        outer(); // Outputs: 30 
        
        -Global Scope:
                - Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
                
                        Example:
                        let a = 40; // a is globally scoped
                        function display() {
                        console.log(a); // Outputs: 40
                        }
                        display();
                        console.log(a); // Outputs: 40  

FUNCTION Expressions
        - A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable.
        - Function expressions can be anonymous or named.
        -it is like defining a function and assigning it to a variable.
        - Syntax:
                let functionName = function(parameters) {
                    // code to be executed
                };

        - Example:
                let add = function(x, y) {
                    return x + y;
                };

                console.log(add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8

        - Named Function Expression:
                let factorial = function fact(n) {
                    if (n <= 1) return 1;
                    return n * fact(n - 1); // Recursive call
                };

                console.log(factorial(5)); // Outputs: 120

HIGH ORDER FUNCTION 
        - A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments 
               or returns a function as its result.
        - Higher-order functions allow for functional programming techniques, such as function composition and currying.
        
        - Example of a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument:
                
                function applyOperation(a, b, operation) { // operation is a function passed as an argument
                    return operation(a, b); // Call the passed function
                }

                function add(x, y) {
                    return x + y;
                }

                function multiply(x, y) {
                    return x * y;
                }

                console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, add)); // Outputs: 8
                console.log(applyOperation(5, 3, multiply)); // Outputs: 15

        - Example of a higher-order function that returns a function:
              
                function createMultiplier(factor) { // Returns a function that multiplies by the given factor
                    return function(number) { // Inner function
                        return number * factor;  // Accesses factor from the outer function Scope
                    };
                }

                let double = createMultiplier(2);
                let triple = createMultiplier(3);

                console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
                console.log(triple(5)); // Outputs: 15

METHODS 
        - A method is a function that is a property of an object.
        - Methods are used to define behaviors for objects.
        -Action that can be performed on objects.
        - for object when we have to define function , these function are called method.
        - Syntax:
                let objectName = {
                    methodName: function(parameters) {
                        // code to be executed
                    }
                };

        - Example:
                let person = {
                    firstName: "John",
                    lastName: "Doe",
                    fullName: function() { // fullName is a method
                        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; // 'this' refers to the current object
                    }
                };

                console.log(person.fullName()); // Outputs: John Doe
